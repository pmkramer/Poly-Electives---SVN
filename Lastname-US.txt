As a veteran user, I want an option to increase the number of technical elective suggestions, so that I don’t have to keep using the app multiple times for multiple class suggestions.
As a user, I want to have a complete schedule generated for me, so that I don’t have to worry about fitting the classes into my schedule by myself.
As a beginner, I want to have an option to go back and change an answer, so that if I mess up for my first time in using the app I can change my answers without starting over.
